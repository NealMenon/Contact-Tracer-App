# Introduction 
## Notify User of exposure
Users should be able to go about their daily lives, taking necessary precautions, and will be notified if they have possibly been exposed to another person who has tested positive, and potentially suggest next steps for them to follow.
## Preserve User Privacy
Users should rest easy knowing that no data is being sent to any central server. Data is sent to central server only if the a user concedes that he or she has tested positive. User neednâ€™t worry about the app tracking location history as this is not needed to achieve our purpose
